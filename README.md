# NIM
A two player python game
-------------------------
How to play: cross any successive lines in the same row. Last player to make a move loses. Play against
a human or AI. The AI uses:
- minmax/AB pruning
- some promising heuristics
- a data file to store evaluations of states for future use

move input: row, start, end on seperate lines
